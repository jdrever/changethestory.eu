Change the Story offers KS2 resources and hands-on support for teaching climate change, citizenship and digital competence. This is an Erasmus+ project running from now until the summer of 2022.

“The most common criticism I get is that I’m being manipulated and you shouldn’t use children in political ways, because that is abuse, and I can’t think for myself and so on. And I think that is so annoying! I’m also allowed to have a say – why shouldn’t I be able to form my own opinion and try to change people’s minds?”

(Greta Thunberg)

Change the Story empowers pupils to create the future they want: to explore how climate change impacts their lives and to create meaningful stories about how climate change is being tackled now and what needs to be done in the future. Pupils will use digital technology to create stories about climate change, producing new narratives to challenge the status quo, encouraging young people in their school, community and across Europe to take action.

The overall objective of Change the Story is ‘to empower young people to develop compelling stories addressing climate change, using digital technologies to communicate their results and inspire others to take action’. These stories will be sourced from local people about how the community has changed in ways that can be attributed to climate change; stories of local projects which respond to climate change; and critically new stories that are created by young people to explore desired futures and possible action.

Key to delivering Change the Story is the use of digital storytelling as a pedagogy. Digital storytelling is a powerful tool for engaging teachers and pupils. Digital storytelling allows computer, tablet and smart phone users to become creative storytellers, providing them with the freedom to redefine, create and publish powerful new stories and communicate them widely. Digital storytelling also allows young people to share their experiences across cultural boundaries and national borders.  This includes project partners in Turkey, Hungary, Austria and Italy

Selected UK schools will be working with us over three phases:

Cycle 1 – Explore (November 2019 – February 2020): we will carry out a consultation with you to understand your needs and current practice; this will help us to develop learning activities which fit with your school needs. This consultation will consist of a face-to-face meeting and a short questionnaire on digital competences.

Cycle 2 – Plan (March – December 2020): we will work with you to plan how Change the Story will be delivered in your school. This will include the practical details of timetabling, subjects and age groups, and the pedagogical approach to engage pupils in climate change and digital learning to create new and inspiring stories.

Cycle 3 – Implement and Review (March-July 2021): we will produce the final set of draft learning resources ready for you to pilot them with your pupils. Before piloting, we will offer you training and support to ensure you feel confident and competent in using these resources. During the pilot, pupil learning will be assessed, and we will follow-up with a final review to ensure we capture your experience.
